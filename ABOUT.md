### What you will learn
Basics of javascript like variables, operators, functions etc that are needed as a basic knowledge for learning angular, react, express, node and other javascript libraries and frameworks
> [!tip]
> **Even if you don't want to code and just learn, it is fine :)**

**No server setup is required—you can run simple JavaScript commands by following these steps.**
> - Create a html file, say `index.html`
> - Create a js file beside it, say `script.js`
> - Connect the js file to the html file via script tag
>  ```html
>       <script src="script.js"></script>
>   ````
  
**With the files set up, open the HTML file in your browser and move on to editing the JS file.**
> - Install [VS code](https://share.google/y2A0gAEhuLgAUDWSI) text editor on your system.
> - Install the extension called [Live server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) in VS code.
> - Right click on `index.html`
> - Select Open with live server
> - Right click on the webpage in your browser
> - Select Inspect
> - Developer tools is opened
> - Go to Console to find the output of your javascript commands
> - Whenever you edit the js file and save it, immediately output is shown in the console

> [!note]
> **You can also execute js commands directly in console of any webpage**
